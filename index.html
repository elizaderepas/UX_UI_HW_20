          <h1> Fairplay for All Foundation Website Redesign</h1>
          <h2> A UX/UI Case Study</h2>
          <p>Working in a team of 4 UX design students in a 3 week design sprint, 
            my team and I were tasked with redesigning a Non-profit organisation website.<br>
          <h5>My Role:</h5>
          <p>work was distributed through the team and I had a hand in every 
              part of the design process, however, my key areas of focus was the user research, 
              information architecture and testing.</p> 
          <h5>Design Tools:</h5>
          <p>Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects. </p>

          <h4> What is Fairplay Foundation?</h4>
          <p>Fairplay Foundation is a non-profit organisation designed to 
            give children and families in Payatas, Philippines a better 
            chance to succeed in life and break the cycle of poverty for good. </p>
            <br>
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>We hit the ground running firstly by conducting user research and completing a 
            competitor analysis as well as usability tests and a heuristic evaluation of the current site. 
            This was important in identifying how competitors and users behave.  It was of particular 
            interest to seek information pertaining to overseas charities as Fairplay is located in the Philippines.  
            We were able to gain valuable insights in how and why people do/do not donate to charities overseas. <br><br>

            We used brainstorming sessions to analyse the research data to identify current issues with the 
            site, understand the user and their journey and begin ideating on potential solutions. <br><br>
            
            Once we had iterated and tested the Information Architecture we made wireframes and started to 
            design the interface. Empathisising with the user is crucial and thus we made sure to test at 
            every stage of the design process. <br><br>
            
            To gain trust, emotional connect and transparency with the user we utilised a certain photographic 
            style as one of the core elements for establishing transparency, trust and emotional connection with 
            the user.</p>
